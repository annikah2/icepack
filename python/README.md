# icepack-py

This python library contains helper functions in Python that are generally useful in conjunction with `icepack`.
These include:
* preprocessing gridded data sets into a form icepack can use
* plotting the output of finite element simulations
* manipulating and building computational meshes
and so forth.


### Installation

The icepack build system will install this package into the same installation directory as the core C++ library, provided you have python on your system.
Note that these scripts are needed to run the pre- and post-processing scripts in the icepack examples.
